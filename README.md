# ship_ahoy
Alert when ships of interest are about to enter the part of the bay visible from our apartment.

Our apartment looks over part of the San Francisco bay. Alert if a ship of interest is about to enter that area. One side of that area is the part of the bay to the west of the Golden Gate bridge. The other part is the area to the east of Angel Island/Alcatraz.
